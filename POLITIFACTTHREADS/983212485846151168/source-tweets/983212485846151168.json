Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.\n\nA deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.\n\nThe defense team\u2019s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.\n\nWhen the defense counsel asked K.S., \u201cDid you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?\u201d she answered: \u201cNot to my knowledge. I didn\u2019t see him with it.\u201d\n\nThe question was then asked, \u201cAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera \u2013 with a camera or a phone?\u201d\n\nK.S. replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nThe counsel then asked, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t say you saw it on his person, you can\u2019t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?\u201d\n\nK.S. answered, \u201cYes. I cannot say.\u201d\n\nTrying to salvage the state\u2019s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., \u201cDid you see what you believed to be a phone?\u201d\n\nHere comes the shocker. K.S. answered, \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t talked about it because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m remembering it through a dream or I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven\u2019t spoken about it because of that.\u201d\n\nK.S. remembered the photo incident \u201cthrough a dream\u201d? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.\n\nAs the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.\u2019s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.\n\nDefense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 98], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/uGJXC5MgRc", "expanded_url": "https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/", "display_url": "sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greit\u2026", "indices": [75, 98]}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://www.sentinelksmo.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinel KSMO</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 821036469271875589, "id_str": "821036469271875589", "name": "Sentinel KS", "screen_name": "Sentinel_KS", "location": "Kansas, USA", "description": "Holding government and media accountable in Kansas.", "url": "https://t.co/sjTtOAAQme", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/sjTtOAAQme", "expanded_url": "http://www.SentinelKS.org", "display_url": "SentinelKS.org", "indices": [0, 23]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 713, "friends_count": 63, "listed_count": 17, "created_at": "Mon Jan 16 16:48:43 +0000 2017", "favourites_count": 0, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 2064, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "F5F8FA", "profile_background_image_url": null, "profile_background_image_url_https": null, "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1145813063674802176/2V9NBihI_normal.png", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1145813063674802176/2V9NBihI_normal.png", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/821036469271875589/1562017936", "profile_link_color": "1DA1F2", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "C0DEED", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDEEF6", "profile_text_color": "333333", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": true, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 1, "favorite_count": 0, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
