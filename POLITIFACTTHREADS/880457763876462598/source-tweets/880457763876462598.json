Privilege. Obama and his pals liked to call it \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d but they really can\u2019t in this case, can they? In this case the daughter of a president was moved to the front of the line.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last long, however, because just like at home, Malia has issues with staying out of trouble. She was caught, by Embassy Security \u2014 aka the US Marines \u2014 on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador\u2019s carrier pigeons. Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist.\n\nMalia was terminated immediately, her room was cleared and she was escorted from the private areas of the embassy to the common area where she could wait to change the dates on her travel visa so she could return home. She was last seen in the lobby when a black SUV pulled up out front and she willingly got in. Looks like Daddy probably saved the day again.\n\nNo word now on Malia\u2019s next move. She won\u2019t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests. Maybe she can go to work with her benevolent father collecting huge speaking fees for destroying the country.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 82], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/Qtc65TKUdH", "expanded_url": "http://flashnewscorner.com/malia-obama-fired-cushy-internship-spanish-embassy/", "display_url": "flashnewscorner.com/malia-obama-fi\u2026", "indices": [59, 82]}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web Client</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 17163752, "id_str": "17163752", "name": "slo129", "screen_name": "slo129", "location": "Connecticut", "description": "Wife of retired Marine #Constitution#  #God #Country #Patriot # Political #NRA#2nd A, CONSERVATIVE!", "url": null, "entities": {"description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 4164, "friends_count": 4752, "listed_count": 46, "created_at": "Tue Nov 04 18:34:22 +0000 2008", "favourites_count": 1226, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 131987, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "0099B9", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme4/bg.gif", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme4/bg.gif", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/470918475683069952/0nlq7EH-_normal.jpeg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/470918475683069952/0nlq7EH-_normal.jpeg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/17163752/1411917736", "profile_link_color": "0099B9", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "5ED4DC", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "95E8EC", "profile_text_color": "3C3940", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 1, "favorite_count": 0, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
