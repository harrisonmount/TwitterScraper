Email *\n\nTruepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed \u2018assets\u2019 had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000+ \u201cmissing\u201d emails, federal sources said.\n\nThe Russians didn\u2019t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.\n\nAnd while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America\u2019s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary\u2019s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.\n\nAnd a public revelation of that magnitude \u2014 publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary\u2019s sensitive and top secret emails \u2014 would have derailed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn\u2019t simply because it was concealed.\n\nFBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton\u2019s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.\n\nAnd did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary\u2019s emails? The FBI didn\u2019t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.\n\nHundreds of top secret documents and even the president\u2019s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server \u2014 and intercepted by a communist country \u2014 yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton\u2019s and her inner circle\u2019s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.\n\nEven the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI \u2014 specifically Strzok \u2014 about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.\n\nThat same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.\n\nWe could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.\n\nIs anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 91], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [{"screen_name": "YouTube", "name": "YouTube", "id": 10228272, "id_str": "10228272", "indices": [83, 91]}], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/JitxkdTplE", "expanded_url": "http://youtu.be/JXQaRFe6XP4?a", "display_url": "youtu.be/JXQaRFe6XP4?a", "indices": [55, 78]}]}, "source": "<a href=\"https://www.google.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 2361191996, "id_str": "2361191996", "name": "LATEST CONSPIRACY TH", "screen_name": "Ngheo12345", "location": "", "description": "", "url": null, "entities": {"description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 32, "friends_count": 301, "listed_count": 1, "created_at": "Tue Feb 25 14:43:23 +0000 2014", "favourites_count": 44, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 4979, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "C0DEED", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/849908131098275840/MI296seq_normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/849908131098275840/MI296seq_normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/2361191996/1491468810", "profile_link_color": "1DA1F2", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "C0DEED", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDEEF6", "profile_text_color": "333333", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": true, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 1, "favorite_count": 1, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
