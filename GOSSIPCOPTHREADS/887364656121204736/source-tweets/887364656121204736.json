What\u2019s the harm in just a few more glorious moments of slumber, after all? Well, for one, the state of your hair, which is usually a dead giveaway of a hurried, harried morning. Though model-off-duty strands are having a moment right now, there\u2019s a fine line between artfully tousled and tousled by your pillow; luckily, you don\u2019t have to sacrifice finesse the next time you press snooze (for the third time). Ahead, you\u2019ll find seven quick and easy hairstyles that will take three minutes or less to execute\u2014leaving more time for your sweet, sweet dreams.\n\nKeep scrolling to see them all!\n\nTriple Twisted Pony\n\nGetty Images/Jason LaVeris/Contributor\n\nGive your go-to high pony a chic update with this twisted variation. Pull your hair back into a ponytail, separating a small piece to wrap around the hair tie. Split the tail into two parts, and twist each one. Secure the sections, then twist them around themselves and secure them again. Wear it sleek, or fluff the twists for a slightly more undone look.\n\nThe Half-Up Knot\n\nTreasures and Travels\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get easier than this knotted half-updo. Take one two-inch section of hair on either side of your head and gather them together in the back. Twist the sections together as one, twist it into a knot, and then tuck the ends under and pin them in place.\n\nUndone Braid\n\nRefinery 29\n\nA genius way to wear your curly hair down and out of your face, this hairstyle involves melding two french braids into one.\n\nBraided Half-Crown\n\nWireImage / Getty Images\n\nBraid a two-inch section of hair on either side of your face, and secure each end with a mini hair elastic (a spritz of Oribe Texturizing Spray, $48, won\u2019t hurt either). Then, cross each braid over the other and tuck the ends out of sight. Pin everything in place, and flaunt your princess-worthy hair.\n\nDouble Mini Buns\n\nHair Romance\n\nThis easy hairstyle is perfect for medium-length curly hair. Split your hair into two sections, and curl each one into a mini bun. Pin them in place, and breeze out the door.\n\nThe Pineapple\n\nPeopleImages / Getty Images\n\nWe\u2019ve reported on the pineapple hairstyle before as a way to keep natural curls springy while you sleep, but it\u2019s also a chic (and quick) way to wear your hair up during the daytime.\n\nCool-Girl Chignon\n\nJustin Coit\n\nCreated by our own resident hair expert, Jen Atkin, this low bun is the cool girl\u2019s version of a classic chignon.\n\nBarette Bun\n\nThe easiest way to step up your hair game when you\u2019re short on time? Add a hair accessory. We\u2019re partial to this matte black barrette or a diamond-studded phrase like the Kitsch X Justine Marjan Rhinestone Glam Bobby Pin ($29).\n\nThe Double-Knotted Pony\n\nLes \u00c8claireuses\n\nBefore you start, know this: This hairstyle works best on those with fine, thin strands. Split your hair into two sections and tie them in a knot\u2014then, knot them again. Pin it all in place with a hairpin, and spray some hairspray to keep it from moving.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 105], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/fG4dy5cKW6", "expanded_url": "http://eonli.ne/2tmYIGW", "display_url": "eonli.ne/2tmYIGW", "indices": [82, 105]}], "media": [{"id": 887364653608837121, "id_str": "887364653608837121", "indices": [106, 129], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFCNc3SXoAE-I28.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFCNc3SXoAE-I28.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/Q5tYdj96xO", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/Q5tYdj96xO", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/EOnlineStyle/status/887364656121204736/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 765, "h": 528, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 469, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 765, "h": 528, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "extended_entities": {"media": [{"id": 887364653608837121, "id_str": "887364653608837121", "indices": [106, 129], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFCNc3SXoAE-I28.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DFCNc3SXoAE-I28.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/Q5tYdj96xO", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/Q5tYdj96xO", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/EOnlineStyle/status/887364656121204736/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 765, "h": 528, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 469, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 765, "h": 528, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://www.socialflow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SocialFlow</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 2387785970, "id_str": "2387785970", "name": "E!
