Check out the list below:\n\nOn the carpet\n\nFashion as a political statement\n\nTonight, actors and allies will #WearOrange pins and ribbons on the #Oscars red carpet to bring awareness to gun violence prevention in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. https://t.co/7BxtM6bTKD \u2014 Everytown (@Everytown) March 4, 2018\n\nAs expected, many attendees sported the signature \u201cTime\u2019s up\u201d black and white pin.\n\nAnother popular pin spotted on the carpet? #WearOrange pins and ribbons from gun control group Everytown. They were worn in an effort to raise awareness about gun safety.\n\nPuerto Rico still on the mind\n\nDuring an interview with Michael Strahan, \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda encouraged viewers to visit Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda encourages viewers to visit Puerto Rico after devastating hurricane: \u201cKeep Puerto Rico in the conversation...keep Puerto Rico in your hearts.\u201d https://t.co/exBwXimwm1 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/kBxhqLo1UG \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018\n\n\u201cKeep Puerto Rico in the conversation. I know there\u2019s no shortage of things in the news, but keep Puerto Rico in your hearts,\u201d Miranda said.\n\nHe added that tourism is \u201cthe lifeblood\u201d of Puerto Rico, and urged people to \u201cspend money there.\u201d\n\nOn average, 87% of the island has power, but sources told CNN that about 150,000 US citizens on the island still don\u2019t have electricity. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and help. He has questioned the US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 response on the island compared with other states dealing with disaster.\n\nMiranda has been an outspoken critic of the government response to Puerto Rico\u2019s needs, and had strong words for President Donald Trump following his criticism of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz last year.\n\nIn October of 2017, Miranda released a song \u2013 with help from 22 other artists \u2013 to raise money for hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.\n\nPolitical activists attended Hollywood\u2019s biggest night\n\nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards attended the Oscars with Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, and Bryan Stevenson, Equal Justice Initiative director. The three posed on the red carpet ahead of the show.\n\nRichards, who announced in January that she is leaving the role later this year, posted a photo on Instagram. \u201cSo the Oscars are cool but being with Bryan and Patrisse is 100,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJimmy Kimmel\u2019s opener\n\nKimmel returned to the helm as host on Sunday. He of course had a few envelope jokes, referencing the envelope mix-up last year that initially (and mistakenly) resulted in \u201cLa La Land\u201d being named the best picture winner over \u201cMoonlight\u201d at the 89th Academy Awards.\n\nBut there were also a few political zingers.\n\nWakanda\n\nBefore kicking off his monologue, Kimmel did an old Hollywood-like voiceover to black and white footage from this year\u2019s red carpet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Chadwick Boseman,\u201d he said at one point, as footage of the \u201cBlack Panther\u201d actor played. \u201cThe king of Wakanda! Imagine that! A country with a black leader. Wouldn\u2019t that be swell?\u201d\n\nFox News\n\nLater, while talking about Harvey Weinstein \u2013 and the subsequent powerful #MeToo movement and Time\u2019s Up initiative \u2013 Kimmel joked about the awards show statuette: Oscar.\n\n\u201cOscar is 89 years old this year, which probably means he\u2019s at home watching Fox News,\u201d Kimmel said, a jab at the network news channel\u2019s older, more conservative viewers.\n\nHe went on to clarify that \u201cOscar is a very respected man in Hollywood. Just look at him: He keeps his hands where he can see them, no penis.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet Out\u201d and Trump\n\nThe first Trump joke came about 10 minutes into Kimmel\u2019s monologue.\n\n\u201cNone other than President Trump called \u2018Get Out\u2019 the best 3/4 of a movie so far this year,\u201d Kimmel said when addressing the mastermind behind the film, Jordan Peele\n\nThe horror film, which has received praise for its performances and thought-provoking take on race in America, received four Academy Award nominations, including one for best picture.\n\nCalling out Vice President Mike Pence\n\nKimmel made a joke about Pence while talking about best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet, nominated for the film \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d a gay love story.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make films like \u2018Call Me By Your Name for money,\u201d Kimmel said, while talking about how the film was critically acclaimed but didn\u2019t do as well at the box office. \u201cWe make them to upset Mike Pence.\u201d\n\nKimmel during the show\n\nHope Hicks\u2019 departure\n\nKimmel made another White House joke while introducing director Greta Gerwig and actress Laura Dern before they presented the best documentary feature category.\n\n\u201cIf the last two years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that reality can be \u2026 depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut tonight\u2019s nominated documentaries show us that where there is darkness, there is also hope. Except at the White House. Hope quit on Wednesday.\u201d\n\nHicks, the former White House communications director and one of Trump\u2019s longest-serving and closest aides, resigned last week.\n\nPutin burn\n\nThe Russian Olympics doping documentary \u201cIcarus\u201d took home best documentary feature on Sunday.\n\nThe film, from filmmaker Bryan Fogel, delves into the controversy around performance-enhancing drugs in sports. It follows the eccentric Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the whistleblower who exposed what a leading report called a doping \u201ccover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale\u201d in Russia (read CNN\u2019s story on this here).\n\nRussia was banned from the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics following state-sponsored doping, leading up to and including the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nKimmel\u2019s response to \u201cIcarus\u201d winning? \u201cAt least we know Putin didn\u2019t rig this competition.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of \u2018Icarus\u2019 \u2026\n\nDuring his acceptance speech, Fogel got a little political himself.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this award to Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, our fearless whistleblower, who now lives in great danger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope \u2018Icarus\u2019 is a wake-up call \u2013 yes, about Russia, but more importantly, about telling the truth.\u201d\n\nAn ad that stood out\n\nWe stand with women around the world to make their voices heard and their presence known. To bring them front and center, today and every day. Join us as we say #HereWeArehttps://t.co/bVXGJ1NibP \u2014 Twitter (@Twitter) March 5, 2018\n\nTwitter premiered an ad called #HereWeAre during the Oscars with a message empowering women leaders. While the ad was not explicitly political, it included an implicit reference to immigration rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIf this poem is the only thing that survives me, tell them this is how it happened: Tell them I built me a throne. Tell them when we discovered life on another planet it was a woman and she built a bridge \u2013 not a border. I heard that this is how you make history. This is how you create a new world.\u201d\n\nA shout out to the Dreamers\n\nOscar nominee Kumail Nanjiani, co-writer and star of \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d and Oscar winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o addressed one of the biggest political debates of the year: immigration.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has enabled hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants \u2013 sometimes called Dreamers \u2013 who were brought to the United States as children to come out from the shadows and openly attend school and get work permits and driver\u2019s licenses without fear of being deported.\n\nTrump announced the end of the DACA program last fall, giving Congress a March 5 deadline to come up with an alternate solution. But that deadline became moot after two separate district courts ruled that the administration must keep accepting renewal applications for the program, effectively putting the termination on hold.\n\n\u201cLike everyone in this room and everyone watching at home we are dreamers,\u201d said Nyong\u2019o, who is from Kenya. \u201cWe grew up dreaming of one day working in the movies. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood, and dreams are the foundation of America.\u201d\n\nNanjiani added: \u201cTo all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you.\u201d\n\nCommon, Andra Day and activists share stage\n\nCommon and Day performed the song \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from the film \u201cMarshall.\u201d The performance was perhaps the most political moment of the night, as the artists were joined onstage by a handful of activists, including:\n\nRichards, of Planned Parenthood\n\nCullors, of Black Lives Matter\n\nAlice Brown Otter, of Standing Rock Youth Council\n\nBana Alabed, author and Syrian refugee\n\nStevenson, of Equal Justice Initiative\n\nDolores Huerta, of Dolores Huerta Foundation and United Farm Workers of America\n\nJanet Mock, of #GirlsLikeUs\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, of ThinkFoodGroup\n\nNicole Hockley, of Sandy Hook Promise\n\nTarana Burke, of #MeToo\n\nCommon called out the National Rifle Association during his rap.\n\n\u201cTell the NRA they ain\u2019t God\u2019s way and tell the people of Parkland we say \u00e0se (a West African philosophy about creating change).,\u201d the Oscar-winning rapper said, referring to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead last month.\n\nThe NRA responded to Common on Twitter. The organization wrote: \u201c@common @TheAcademy: This is what the #NRA and its members stand for. #Oscars.\u201d The tweet included a video of Dom Raso, a Navy SEAL veteran.\n\n#TimesUp in the spotlight\n\nAshley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek praise the #MeToo, #TimesUp movements: \"The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, of different voices, of our voices.\" https://t.co/wst3Hx4GJF #Oscars pic.twitter.com/dBqhimu402 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018\n\nAshley Judd, Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek \u2013 three of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s accusers \u2013 also shared an emotional moment onstage, before introducing a video that featured many of the Oscar nominees and others in the industry talking about the importance of diversity in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThe changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, different voices, of our voices, who are joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time\u2019s Up,\u201d Judd said.\n\nThe video featured interviews with Nanjiani, Ava Duvernay, Greta Gerwig, Barry Jenkins and others.\n\n\u201cSome of my favorite movies are by straight white dudes, about straight white dudes,\u201d Nanjiani says in the video. \u201cNow you can watch my movies and relate to me. It\u2019s not that hard. I\u2019ve been doing it my whole life.\u201d\n\nGuillermo del Toro \u2018erases lines in the sand\u2019\n\nMexican filmmaker del Toro won best director on Sunday for \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d making him the third director from Mexico to win the category. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n won for \u201cGravity\u201d in 2014 and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu won for \u201cBirdman\u201d in 2015 and \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in 2016.\n\nThe trio, who some in Hollywood deem the \u201cthree amigos,\u201d have a production company called Cha Cha Cha Films.\n\n\u201cI am an immigrant,\u201d del Toro said in his speech. \u201cIn the last 25 years, I\u2019ve been living in a country all of our own. The greatest thing our industry does is to erase lines in the sand. We should continue to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d also won the biggest award of the night \u2013 best picture \u2013 to bring its total statuettes to four.\n\nCNN\u2019s Deena Zaru and Parija Kavilanz contributed to this report", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 78], "entities": {"hashtags": [{"text": "Oscars", "indices": [15, 22]}], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/daf3Yv3M98", "expanded_url": "http://cnn.it/2FSvG4U", "display_url": "cnn.it/2FSvG4U", "indices": [55, 78]}], "media": [{"id": 970531043261349888, "id_str": "970531043261349888", "indices": [79, 102], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXgE130VAAAJqLW.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXgE130VAAAJqLW.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/UP60TWT5q3", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/UP60TWT5q3", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/970531045710974976/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 1100, "h": 619, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 1100, "h": 619, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 383, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "extended_entities": {"media": [{"id": 970531043261349888, "id_str": "970531043261349888", "indices": [79, 102], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXgE130VAAAJqLW.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXgE130VAAAJqLW.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/UP60TWT5q3", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/UP60TWT5q3", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/970531045710974976/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 1100, "h": 619, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 1100, "h": 619, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 383, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://www.socialflow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">SocialFlow</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 13850422, "id_str": "13850422", "name": "CNN Politics", "screen_name": "CNNPolitics", "location": "Washington, DC", "description": "Political news, campaign stories and Washington coverage from CNN Politics.", "url": "https://t.co/KWFMkrEjdY", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/KWFMkrEjdY", "expanded_url": "http://cnn.com/politics", "display_url": "cnn.com/politics", "indices": [0, 23]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 4126281, "friends_count": 344, "listed_count": 20890, "created_at": "Sat Feb 23 03:12:49 +0000 2008", "favourites_count": 4, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": true, "statuses_count": 200068, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "100F14", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": true, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/918899077168934912/NrRRE0_b_normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/918899077168934912/NrRRE0_b_normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/13850422/1605728394", "profile_link_color": "0000FF", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "FFFFFF", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "F1F5E7", "profile_text_color": "000000", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 13, "favorite_count": 63, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
