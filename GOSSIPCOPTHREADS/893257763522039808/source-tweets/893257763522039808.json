Not only is it always glowing and radiant, but her pores are virtually non-existent, she has an even skin tone and she doesn\u2019t seem to have had a pimple in years.\n\nSo, it is understandable that when the model and founder of skin care brand KORA Organics shared her top skin care tips with Teen Vogue, including the product she uses to clear her blemishes overnight, we were all ears.\n\nAccording to the model, facial oils are her go-to when confronted with a surprise pimple. \u201cIf I\u2019m having a breakout, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my Noni Glow Oil. I find that really helps, even with treating it overnight. I put it on after cleansing, misting, exfoliating and moisturising,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile we\u2019re not debating the effectiveness the oil has on Miranda\u2019s skin, we wanted to check in with a skin care expert to find out if facial oils can work as an effective pimple treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice from Bryan Barron Director of Research and Content at Paula\u2019s Choice, is anything to go by, it isn\u2019t good news.\n\nIn fact, Barron says, \u201cWhile some people report success using oils to banish breakouts, mounds of research has shown that gently removing excess oil and controlling acne-causing bacteria with benzoyl peroxide, and using a leave-on exfoliant with salicylic acid is a proven, reliable approach for acne at any age.\u201d\n\nUltimately, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine as they work wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, using them as a pimple treatment may not deliver the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.\n\nWant more information on facial oils?
