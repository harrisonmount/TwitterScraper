Granted they are not focusing much attention on their exes\u2019 sex and family lives, but they would be OK if that were to happen and they would only hope they would accept things if Blake and Gwen become a family themselves. They are interested in moving forward on good terms and don\u2019t want to have any drama with their exes, so they are thinking positively about them when they are ever brought up. It is pointless to stress about things you cannot control. They are going just to be happy, and things will work out how they are supposed to work out.\u201d\n\nThe same so-called pal denied that Stefani is pregnant with Shelton's baby and added: \u201cGwen is most definitely not pregnant. Blake has been low-key hoping for a while that they might have a happy accident and Gwen would wind up pregnant again but for now, that simply is not the case. Gwen is so tiny, if she has a big lunch, she can appear to be three months along. But she is not\u2026not now at least.\u201d\n\nFans say it is time for the music stars to move on and stop talking about their exes even if it is to say positive things.\n\nRossdale never speaks of the mother of his three sons, and Lambert only mentions her ex and their past life together in her music.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 131], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/hgK3sqxobR", "expanded_url": "http://gossipcop.com/enugl", "display_url": "gossipcop.com/enugl", "indices": [108, 131]}], "media": [{"id": 898706282076569600, "id_str": "898706282076569600", "indices": [132, 155], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHjYmhyWAAA6mm7.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHjYmhyWAAA6mm7.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/CwxMsgAXOz", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/CwxMsgAXOz", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/GossipCop/status/898706288749682688/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "extended_entities": {"media": [{"id": 898706282076569600, "id_str": "898706282076569600", "indices": [132, 155], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHjYmhyWAAA6mm7.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DHjYmhyWAAA6mm7.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/CwxMsgAXOz", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/CwxMsgAXOz", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/GossipCop/status/898706288749682688/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "medium": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}, "small": {"w": 594, "h": 395, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web Client</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 25701904, "id_str": "25701904", "name": "Gossip Cop", "screen_name": "GossipCop", "location": "", "description": "Separating Fact From Fiction In Celebrity Reporting", "url": "http://t.co/B5muimrC57", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "http://t.co/B5muimrC57", "expanded_url": "http://www.gossipcop.com/", "display_url": "gossipcop.com", "indices": [0, 22]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 322583, "friends_count": 725, "listed_count": 1985, "created_at": "Sat Mar 21 17:41:30 +0000 2009", "favourites_count": 15562, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": true, "statuses_count": 158852, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "BBC3C7", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": true, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1263581112372088832/lbo_7oBp_normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1263581112372088832/lbo_7oBp_normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/25701904/1590096206", "profile_link_color": "0084B4", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "FFFFFF", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDFFCC", "profile_text_color": "333333", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 1, "favorite_count": 0, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
