Do you believe it?\n\nEddie Cibrian is no saint, that\u2019s for sure, but could he possibly have been foolish enough to try and cheat on now-wife LeAnn Rimes with the same waitress he cheated on ex-wife Brandi Glanville? If the waitress in question, Scheana Marie, is to be believed, the answer is a resounding yes!\n\nIn a new interview with RadarOnline.com, Scheana, 27, claims that Eddie, 39, contacted her after he split with Brandi, 40, in 2009. According to the waitress, who now stars on Bravo\u2019s Vanderpump Rules, Eddie was already dating LeAnn, 30.\n\n\u201cAs months go by, Eddie gets separated. He then contacts me to go out for drinks,\u201d Scheana says. \u201cI believed he was separated, so I was happy to go out with him again. But shortly into trying to hang out with him I find out about LeAnn, and I felt like such an idiot!\u201d\n\nScheana Marie Recalls Meeting Eddie Cibrian\n\nScheana spoke with the website about when she first met Eddie and revealed the surprising source who informed her about Eddie\u2019s lies. \u201cOriginally, I met him seven years ago. When a really good-looking guy with big dimples wants to take you out for drinks your first question isn\u2019t \u2018Are you married because you don\u2019t have a ring on your finger?'\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe hung out, it was quite casual and about six months in, my mom saw an article and was like, \u2018That Eddie guy you are dating, is his last name Cibrian and is he on Third Watch?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, what do you hear?\u2019 And she told me that he and his wife are expecting their second child!\u201d\n\nScheana Confronts Eddie About His Lies\n\nScheana says that she confronted the philandering actor to find out the truth, and he admitted to his lies via text message! \u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry I lied to you.\u2019 He then switched the conversation and said, \u2018By the way, are you still doing the acting thing? I have a project I\u2019m funding, and there\u2019s a role for you that would be great.'\u201d\n\nThe waitress-turned-reality star says that, since their last run-in, she and Eddie haven\u2019t spoken. \u201cI have no interest in talking to him again,\u201d she says.\n\nDo you believe Scheana\u2019s claims that Eddie tried to cheat on LeAnn with her, HollywoodLifers?\n\n\u2014 Billy Nilles\n\nMore on the LeAnn Rimes-Eddie Cibrian-Brandi Glanville Triangle:", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 111], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [{"url": "http://t.co/edfjPLon", "expanded_url": "http://tinyurl.com/ahbtsum", "display_url": "tinyurl.com/ahbtsum", "indices": [74, 94]}]}, "source": "<a href=\"http://www.celebrityballa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balla Network</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 599101729, "id_str": "599101729", "name": "Balla Balla", "screen_name": "ballaballaco", "location": "United States", "description": "The Balla Balla Network: Hot and Trending News about Celebrities, Sports, Movies, TV Shows, Advertisment, Cars and More.", "url": "http://t.co/yIzvo1Uf4u", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "http://t.co/yIzvo1Uf4u", "expanded_url": "http://www.ballaballa.co", "display_url": "ballaballa.co", "indices": [0, 22]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 1232, "friends_count": 47, "listed_count": 131, "created_at": "Mon Jun 04 09:37:54 +0000 2012", "favourites_count": 238, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 171265, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "C0DEED", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/471623743622504448/csZZdGGm_normal.png", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/471623743622504448/csZZdGGm_normal.png", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/599101729/1401278674", "profile_link_color": "1DA1F2", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "C0DEED", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDEEF6", "profile_text_color": "333333", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": true, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 2, "favorite_count": 0, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "possibly_sensitive_appealable": false, "lang": "en"}
