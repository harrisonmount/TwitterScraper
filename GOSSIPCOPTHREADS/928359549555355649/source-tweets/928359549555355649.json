Aside from the singles and music videos, the singer also released behind-the-scenes videos, branded UPS delivery trucks, and invited fans over for private listening parties. Next in the line-up is her special Reputation magazines, which Target will release on Friday, the same day as her album.\n\nSwift's been teasing her personalized publications on social media since she announced her upcoming record. They include handwritten lyrics, personal polaroids, and paintings by the singer.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

She shared the back covers of the publications today, revealing they're designed to look like celebrity tabloid magazine covers.\n\nTaylor Swift / Instagram Story\n\nTaylor Swift / Instagram Story\n\nFans noticed the headlines parody real tabloid stories about the star. The one titled \"Who Is Olivia's Real Father?\" is a playful reference to her cat but also appears to mock one OK! story that reported she was pregnant with the headline, \"Who's The Dad?\" Her second cover, with the headline, \"Why She Disappeared,\" seems to mimic an Us Weekly issue with the same title.\n\nAs Buzzfeed points out, Swift even got the logos down. Her \"TS Swiftly\" emblem looks like Us Weekly's, while her \"TS!!\" one resembles OK!'s.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

While some praise the singer for \"taking back the narrative,\" others disapprove of her attack on the media, which one Cosmo article notes is reflective of Trump's relationship with the press.\n\nSwifties, however, have firmly aligned themselves with the former camp.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
