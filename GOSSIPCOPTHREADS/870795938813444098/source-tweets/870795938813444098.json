Even friend and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve Live\u201d sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound \u2014 one that\u2019s increasingly threatening to derail her career.\n\n\u201cBeing dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,\u201d Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. \u201cHer business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Fox News Panel Ponders If 'Wonder Woman' Is Patriotic Enough\n\nAfter widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she \u201cwent too far.\u201d But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she\u2019s been bullied by Trump\u2019s family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.\n\nBut if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.\n\n\u201cKathy Griffin claims \u2018conspiracy\u2019 at mad, looping press conference,\u201d proclaimed Salon. Jezebel called it a \u201cpoorly conceived mess.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 10 Women Who Have Left Fox News Shows, From Megyn Kelly to Laurie Dhue (Photos)\n\n\u201cI understand when you\u2019re in this situation there\u2019s a natural urge to respond,\u201d public relations expert Howard Bragman told TheWrap, however, \u201cthat has to be done with great caution and consideration.\u201d\n\nAnother top Hollywood publicist, who asked not to be named, said the news conference only made things worse.\n\n\u201cIf she were my client, I\u2019d tell her to shut the f\u2014 up,\u201d the P.R. guru told TheWrap. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to anyone and you\u2019re certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Jim Carrey Defends Kathy Griffin Over Trump Photo: Comedians Are 'Last Line of Defense'\n\nAccording to the publicist, who said he likes Griffin, her approach was ill-conceived because it lacked any perceivable strategy.\n\n\u201cWhat is she trying to accomplish?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs she trying to sue Trump? Good luck with that. Is she trying to say she\u2019s the victim? I think 99 percent of the people would disagree with that. She did this to herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly keeps her in the news,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso Read: 11 Shows That Aren't About Trump -- But Totally Were (Photos)\n\nAll three publicists said Griffin will likely retain her core fans who have supported her for years and who are mostly anti-Trump liberals.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have to lay low for a while and then come back and address the elephant in the room, maybe make fun of herself,\u201d the P.R. expert went on to say. \u201cThe gays are not going to leave her. This will go away if she just shuts up. There is a real crisis in this country right now and anything she says is just a distraction.\u201d\n\nThe good news for Griffin is that she can recover \u2026 but it might take a while for the whole thing to blow over.\n\nAlso Read: 34 Streaming TV Shows You Can Binge Watch in a Weekend (Photos)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to have to recalibrate and reconsider,\u201d Bragman said. \u201cBut in no way is this going to end her career. She\u2019s funny, she\u2019s immensely talented.
