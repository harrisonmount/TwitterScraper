They had such a passionate love affair. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy for her to get over, not without a fight to match the size of their love. The fact is, Angelina\u2019s deeply hurt that they couldn\u2019t keep things together and have their happy Hollywood ending and she puts all the blame for that failure on Brad.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this explains the nasty turn Brad and Angelina\u2019s custody battle has taken, with her lobbing allegations of unpaid child support at her ex. \u201cInstead of facing her sadness and working through it,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com, \u201cher coping mechanism is to go full ice queen. Sadly it is the only way she can get through this divorce. If she doesn\u2019t focus on her anger and stay in that frame of mind, she would crumble and possibly even have a breakdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not an option\u201d for Angie, the source added. \u201cShe has to stay strong for her kids and unfortunately for Brad, \u2018staying strong\u2019 means \u2018staying angry.\u2019 \u201c Angie\u2019s anger, while helping her keep it together for her kids, but actually backfire and cost her the one thing she\u2019s trying to protect. Angelina\u2019s \u201ccarefully word-smithed\u201d accusation \u2013 where she claimed Brad didn\u2019t pay \u201cmeaningful\u201d child support \u2013 might come off as insincere to the judge overseeing the case, California family law attorney David Pisarra EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it backfires on her, as more and more judges are starting to see through these tactics quicker.\u201d\n\nBrad \u2013 who has denied the accusations by saying he\u2019s paid more than $9 million to Angelina \u2013 can\u2019t stand the fact that she\u2019s taken the battle public again. Brad fears that the added spotlight to this battle\u2019s bitterness is \u201churting the kids,\u201d and that nothing good can come from a nasty custody dispute. He was coping with the breakup when everything was sealed behind clothes doors, but now that it\u2019s out in the open, Brad feels like she\u2019s \u201ctaken off the gloves and is fighting dirty.\u201d", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 101], "entities": {"hashtags": [{"text": "BradPitt", "indices": [12, 21]}, {"text": "AngelinaJolie", "indices": [49, 63]}], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/android\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for Android</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 898786896, "id_str": "898786896", "name": "Sean Drew", "screen_name": "Drewniak12345", "location": "Budd Lake, West Town, NJ", "description": "Landscape Artichect, Skater, Tall Basketball Player, Loves Half Sausage and Extra Cheese", "url": null, "entities": {"description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 44, "friends_count": 1, "listed_count": 1, "created_at": "Tue Oct 23 00:48:18 +0000 2012", "favourites_count": 39, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": true, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 18867, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "000000", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme4/bg.gif", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme4/bg.gif", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1379402508750176258/nUQsFrHB_normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1379402508750176258/nUQsFrHB_normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/898786896/1614719685", "profile_link_color": "1B95E0", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "000000", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "000000", "profile_text_color": "000000", "profile_use_background_image": false, "has_extended_profile": true, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": false, "follow_request_sent": false, "notifications": false, "translator_type": "none", "withheld_in_countries": []}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": {"id": "32832fcb3a6e2d77", "url": "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/geo/id/32832fcb3a6e2d77.json", "place_type": "city", "name": "Budd Lake", "full_name": "Budd Lake, NJ", "country_code": "US", "country": "United States", "contained_within": [], "bounding_box": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [[[-74.782723, 40.843026], [-74.71025, 40.843026], [-74.71025, 40.907135], [-74.782723, 40.907135]]]}, "attributes": {}}, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 4, "favorite_count": 11, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "lang": "en"}
